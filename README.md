## About
This is a very simple "2D shuffle-slots" game.
On every spin/shuffle there is a chance of getting either a rectangle/column/row/whole area with the correct parts of the image put together.
Once that happens the user's score for that round equals TheCorrectArea*Multiplier*BetValue.
The multiplier value depends on the type of result.
* 1 for a rectangle
* 2 for a row
* 3 for a column
* 4 for the whole area

The higher the multiplier the smaller the chance of occurring.

After each shuffle with no valid area, the bet value is deducted from the initial deposit.
